                        <h1>Fee &amp; Booking Policy</h1>

                        <p>LAST UPDATED: 12th February 2016</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>Your plans while you're on exchange in Singapore are always subject to change. Taking this into consideration, all local hosts on our platform commit to help you with a flexible booking policy. Below are our marketplace policies relating to fees, cancellations and refunds. It is at our sole discretion to amend these policies from time to time and it is your responsibility to regularly check the Site (http://www.tripbuddy.sg) to determine if there have been changes.</p>


                        <h2>1. FEES</h2>

                        <p>There are two types of fees involved in our marketplace transactions. You may refer below for the detailed description of each fee. If you have any questions on our fee policy, please contact us at contact@tripbuddy.sg.</p>

                        <p>a. Processing Fee
                            <br>For every booking between buyers and sellers, TripBuddy collects a processing fee of 7% of the total value. This processing fee shall be deducted directly from the amount paid to us, and is non-refundable in all circumstances, unless your trip/activity/event is cancelled by the seller. The processing fee is used for our marketplace maintenance and geographical expansion to serve you better.</p>

                        <p>b. Transaction Fee
                            <br>Our payment system accepts credit/debit cards supported by Stripe. All payments transacted through Stripe are subject to a Stripe fee. The Stripe fee is comprised of a fixed component and a variable component. This fee is borne by sellers and according to Stripe, the variable component will be refunded on a pro-rata basis in case of approved cancellation. The Stripe fee and its refund policy may change from time to time at the discretion of Stripe. If you would like to know more about Stripe fees, please refer to the Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/sg/pricing" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>


                        <h2>2. CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>

                        <p>You are allowed to request for cancellation of your booking(s) at least 24 hours prior to 12:00 AM local time of the activity date. All cancellation requests shall be reviewed by our team and the purchaser will be informed of the outcome by email. An approved cancellation request shall incur a processing fee of 7% of the total booking value. Late cancellation requests are considered a "no-show" and will incur full booking charges.</p>


                        <h2>3. REFUND POLICY</h2>

                        <p>Refunds arising from any cancellation shall be informed by messaging the seller &amp; purchasers directly on their provided email addresses. Fund transfer will be processed within ten (10) working days from the email date.</p>

                        <p>If you have any questions about our policies, you can email us at contact@tripbuddy.sg.</p>
